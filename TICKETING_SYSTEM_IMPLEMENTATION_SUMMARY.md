# Ticketing System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive ticketing/complaint management system for the atiohaidar.github.io portfolio application.

## Problem Statement (Translation)
The requirement was to create a ticketing system for complaint management with:
- Categories for different complaint types
- Guest submission without login
- Token-based tracking for guests to monitor progress
- Admin capabilities to manage, respond, and assign tickets
- Ability for staff to reassign tickets to each other
- Guest ability to respond/comment using their token
- Comment functionality disabled once ticket is solved
- Dashboard view for logged-in users
- Consistent design with existing application

## Solution Delivered

### âœ… Completed Features

#### 1. Database Layer
- Created migration `008_add_ticketing.sql` with 4 tables:
  - `ticket_categories` - 5 default categories (Technical, Support, Feature Request, Complaint, Other)
  - `tickets` - Main ticket storage with token, status, priority
  - `ticket_comments` - Comments with guest/user distinction and internal notes
  - `ticket_assignments` - Complete assignment history tracking
- Proper indexes for performance optimization
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

#### 2. Backend API (18 Endpoints)
**Public Endpoints (4)** - No authentication required:
- `POST /api/public/tickets` - Submit ticket, get token
- `GET /api/public/tickets/:token` - Track ticket by token
- `GET /api/public/tickets/:token/comments` - View comments
- `POST /api/public/tickets/:token/comments` - Add comment as guest

**Authenticated Endpoints (14)** - Require login:
- Category management (1 endpoint)
- Ticket CRUD operations (5 endpoints)
- Comment management (2 endpoints)
- Assignment operations (2 endpoints)
- Statistics (1 endpoint)
- Search and filtering support

#### 3. Frontend Components

**Landing Page (Public)**:
- `TicketSubmissionSection` - Guest submission form
  - Category selection
  - Priority selection (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Optional name and email
  - Optional reference link
  - Success modal with token display
  
- `TicketTrackingSection` - Token-based tracking
  - Token input with validation
  - Full ticket details display
  - Status and priority badges
  - Comment history (excluding internal notes)
  - Add comment form (if not solved)

**Dashboard (Authenticated)**:
- `DashboardTicketsPage` - Ticket list management
  - Statistics cards (total, open, in_progress, waiting, solved)
  - Filter by status, category
  - Search functionality
  - Assigned user filter (admin only)
  - Sortable table with status indicators
  
- `DashboardTicketDetailPage` - Ticket detail management
  - Edit mode for ticket details (admin)
  - Status and priority update
  - Comment section with internal notes checkbox
  - Assignment form with notes
  - Assignment history display
  - Prevent comments on solved tickets

#### 4. User Experience
- Consistent design using existing `COLORS` utility
- Dark/light theme support throughout
- Responsive mobile-friendly design
- Clear status indicators with color coding:
  - Open: Blue
  - In Progress: Yellow
  - Waiting: Orange
  - Solved: Green
- Priority badges with appropriate colors
- Loading states and error handling
- Form validation

## User Flows Implemented

### Guest Flow
1. Visit landing page
2. Scroll to "Ajukan Komplain / Keluhan" section
3. Fill form and submit
4. Receive unique token (e.g., TKT-ABC12345)
5. Save token for tracking
6. Later, scroll to "Lacak Status Keluhan"
7. Enter token to view status and comments
8. Add comments if needed (until solved)

### Admin/Staff Flow
1. Login to dashboard
2. Click "Tiket" ðŸŽ« in sidebar
3. View all tickets with statistics
4. Filter/search as needed
5. Click ticket for details
6. Update status, priority, or details
7. Add comments (public or internal)
8. Assign to other users if needed
9. Mark as solved when complete

## Status Workflow

Flexible status changes in any direction:
- **open** â†’ New ticket, unassigned
- **in_progress** â†’ Being worked on
- **waiting** â†’ Awaiting response
- **solved** â†’ Completed (no new comments)

Admin can move between any statuses as needed for workflow flexibility.
