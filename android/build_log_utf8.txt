       1.  Dependency 
'androidx.core:core:1.15.0' 
requires libraries and 
applications that
           depend on it to 
compile against version 35 
or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is 
currently compiled against 
android-34.
     
           Recommended 
action: Update this project 
to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 35, 
for example 35.
     
           Note that 
updating a library or 
application's compileSdk 
(which
           allows newer 
APIs to be used) can be 
done separately from 
updating
           targetSdk (which 
opts the app in to new 
runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which 
determines which devices 
the app can be installed
           on).
